- 👋 Hi, I’m @nicolafan
- 👀 I’m interested in web development and Android development (both Front and Back-End), Machine Learning with Python, application development and algorithms.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on coding projects on GitHub, I think this will be a method for deeply understanding what I'm studying. 
- 📫 How to reach me: forums or my email address.
- 📚 At the moment I'm a Computer Science student in Italy.
