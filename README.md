- 👋 Hi, I’m @nicolafan
- 👀 I’m interested in Android development (both Front and Back-End), Machine Learning with Python, application development and algorithms.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Machine Learning algorithms and models, algorithms and Android development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Android projects and applications or projects about Machine Learning, I think this will be a method for deeply understand what I'm studying. 
- 📫 How to reach me: forums or my email address.
- 📚 At the moment I'm a Computer Science student in Italy.
