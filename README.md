ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nicola Fanelli.

I am a third-year PhD student at the University of Bari working on **deep learning for computer vision**.

I'm especially interested in **multimodal models** leveraging both images and text to analyze art, but I always keep an eye on the latest developments in the broader deep learning domain.
